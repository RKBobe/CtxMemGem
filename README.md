# CtxMemGem üß†
CtxMemGem is a personal AI memory and synthesis engine that provides a large language model with contextual understanding of your codebase, enabling more relevant and insightful assistance.

## 
Core Functionality
GitHub Integration: Securely connects to your GitHub account via OAuth to access specified repositories.

Code Processing: Reads and processes text-based files, breaking them down into logical, understandable chunks.

Semantic Embedding: Uses a local AI model to generate vector embeddings, capturing the semantic meaning of your code without sending the code itself to an external service.

Vector Storage: Stores these embeddings in a ChromaDB vector database to create a persistent, searchable "memory" of your projects.

Context-Aware Q&A: Provides a powerful API that retrieves the most relevant code snippets based on your natural language questions and synthesizes them for an AI-powered answer.

How It Works üöÄ
This tool implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline:

Ingest: The code from a repository is chunked and converted into vector embeddings, which are stored in the memory.

Retrieve: When you ask a question, the engine performs a semantic search on the stored memory to find the most relevant code snippets.

Augment & Synthesize: These snippets are combined with your original question into a detailed prompt. This prompt is then sent to the Google Gemini API, allowing it to generate an answer that is deeply grounded in the specific context of your work.
